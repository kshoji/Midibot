Midibot
=======
Realtime music playable 3D Printer driver

Notice
======
This project based on very old ReplicatorG (0018??). I'll replace the ReplicatorG's class, near future.

Requirement
===========

- a 3D Printer : cofigured with [RepricatorG](https://github.com/makerbot/ReplicatorG)

How to use
==========

1. Download [the jar](https://raw.github.com/kshoji/Midibot/master/Midibot.jar).
2. Just open the jar file, or execute from command line.

```
java -jar Midibot.jar jp.kshoji.MidibotMain
```

3. Choose your MIDI device to play with.

4. Play the music with 3D printer. 

I intend to have developed this library so that the machine does not crash. But at the first time to use this, be careful not to hit the nozzle with the build platform.
